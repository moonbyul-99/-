Working through this part will help us become acutely familiar with the behind the scenes work of implementing Pytorch Message Passing Layers, allowing us to build our own GNN models. To do so, we will work with and implement 3 critcal functions needed to define a PyG Message Passing Layer: `forward`, `message`, and `aggregate`.\n","\n","Before diving head first into the coding details, let us quickly review the key components of the message passing process. To do so, we will focus on a single round of messsage passing with respect to a single central node $x$. Before message passing, $x$ is associated with a feature vector $x^{l-1}$, and the goal of message passing is to update this feature vector as $x^l$. To do so, we implement the following steps: 1) each neighboring node $v$ passes its current message $v^{l-1}$ across the edge $(x, v)$ - 2) for the node $x$, we aggregate all of the messages of the neighboring nodes (for example through a sum or mean) - and 3) we transform the aggregated information by for example applying linear and non-linear transformations. Altogether, the message passing process is applied such that every node $u$ in our graph updates its embedding by acting as the central node $x$ in step 1-3 described above.\n","\n","Now, we extending this process to that of a single message passing layer, the job of a message passing layer is to update the current feature representation or embedding of each node in a graph by propagating and transforming information within the graph. Overall, the general paradigm of a message passing layers is: 1) pre-processing -> 2) **message passing** / propagation -> 3) post-processing.\n","\n","The `forward` fuction that we will implement for our message passing layer captures this execution logic. Namely, the `forward` function handles the pre and post-processing of node features / embeddings, as well as initiates message passing by calling the `propagate` function.\n","\n","\n","The `propagate` function encapsulates the message passing process! It does so by calling three important functions: 1) `message`, 2) `aggregate`, and 3) `update`. Our implementation will vary slightly from this, as we will not explicitly implement `update`, but instead place the logic for updating node embeddings after message passing and within the `forward` function. To be more specific, after information is propagated (message passing), we can further transform the node embeddings outputed by `propagate`. Therefore, the output of `forward` is exactly the node embeddings after one GNN layer.\n","\n","Lastly, before starting to implement our own layer, let us dig a bit deeper into each of the functions described above:\n","\n","1.\n","\n","```\n","def propagate(edge_index, x=(x_i, x_j), extra=(extra_i, extra_j), size=size):\n","```\n","Calling `propagate` initiates the message passing process. Looking at the function parameters, we highlight a couple of key parameters.\n","\n","  - `edge_index` is passed to the forward function and captures the edge structure of the graph.\n","  - `x=(x_i, x_j)` represents the node features that will be used in message passing. In order to explain why we pass the tuple `(x_i, x_j)`, we first look at how our edges are represented. For every edge $(i, j) \\in E$, we can differentiate $i$ as the source or central node ($x_{central}$) and j as the neighboring node ($x_{neighbor}$).\n","  \n","    Taking the example of message passing above, for a central node $u$ we will aggregate and transform all of the messages associated with the nodes $v$ s.t. $(u, v) \\in E$ (i.e. $v \\in N_{u}$). Thus we see, the subscripts `_i` and `_j` allow us to specifcally differenciate features associated with central nodes (i.e. nodes  recieving message information) and neighboring nodes (i.e. nodes passing messages).\n","\n","    This is definitely a somewhat confusing concept; however, one key thing to remember / wrap your head around is that depending on the perspective, a node $x$ acts as a central node or a neighboring node. In fact, in undirected graphs we store both edge directions (i.e. $(i, j)$ and $(j, i)$). From the central node perspective, `x_i`, x is collecting neighboring information to update its embedding. From a neighboring node perspective, `x_j`, x is passing its message information along the edge connecting it to a different central node.\n","\n","  - `extra=(extra_i, extra_j)` represents additional information that we can associate with each node beyond its current feature embedding. In fact, we can include as many additional parameters of the form `param=(param_i, param_j)` as we would like. Again, we highlight that indexing with `_i` and `_j` allows us to differentiate central and neighboring nodes.\n","\n","  The output of the `propagate` function is a matrix of node embeddings after the message passing process and has shape $[N, d]$.\n","\n","2.\n","```\n","def message(x_j, ...):\n","```\n","The `message` function is called by propagate and constructs the messages from\n","neighboring nodes $j$ to central nodes $i$ for each edge $(i, j)$ in *edge_index*. This function can take any argument that was initially passed to `propagate`. Furthermore, we can again differentiate central nodes and neighboring nodes by appending `_i` or `_j` to the variable name, .e.g. `x_i` and `x_j`. Looking more specifically at the variables, we have:\n","\n","  - `x_j` represents a matrix of feature embeddings for all neighboring nodes passing their messages along their respective edge (i.e. all nodes $j$ for edges $(i, j) \\in E$). Thus, its shape is $[|E|, d]$!\n","  - In implementing GAT we will see how to access additional variables passed to propagate\n","\n","  Critically, we see that the output of the `message` function is a matrix of neighboring node embeddings ready to be aggregated, having shape $[|E|, d]$.\n","\n","3.\n","```\n","def aggregate(self, inputs, index, dim_size = None):\n","```\n","Lastly, the `aggregate` function is used to aggregate the messages from neighboring nodes.

One of the major benefits of attention-based mechanisms is their ability to focus on the most relevant parts of the input to make decisions. In this problem, we will see how attention mechanisms can be used to perform node classification over graph-structured data through the usage of Graph Attention Networks (GATs) ([Veličković et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903)).\n","\n","The building block of the Graph Attention Network is the graph attention layer, which is a variant of the aggregation function. Let $N$ be the number of nodes and $F$ be the dimension of the feature vector for each node. The input to each graph attentional layer is a set of node features: $\\mathbf{h} = \\{\\overrightarrow{h_1}, \\overrightarrow{h_2}, \\dots, \\overrightarrow{h_N}$\\}, $\\overrightarrow{h_i} \\in R^F$. The output of each graph attentional layer is a new set of node features, which may have a new dimension $F'$: $\\mathbf{h'} = \\{\\overrightarrow{h_1'}, \\overrightarrow{h_2'}, \\dots, \\overrightarrow{h_N'}\\}$, with $\\overrightarrow{h_i'} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F'}$.\n","\n","We will now describe how this transformation is performed for each graph attention layer. First, a shared linear transformation parametrized by the weight matrix $\\mathbf{W} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F' \\times F}$ is applied to every node.\n","\n","Next, we perform self-attention on the nodes. We use a shared attention function $a$:\n","\\begin{equation}\n","a : \\mathbb{R}^{F'} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{F'} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}.\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","that computes the attention coefficients capturing the importance of node $j$'s features to node $i$:\n","\\begin{equation}\n","e_{ij} = a(\\mathbf{W_l}\\overrightarrow{h_i}, \\mathbf{W_r} \\overrightarrow{h_j})\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","The most general formulation of self-attention allows every node to attend to all other nodes which drops all structural information. However, to utilize graph structure in the attention mechanisms, we use **masked attention**. In masked attention, we only compute attention coefficients $e_{ij}$ for nodes $j \\in N_i$ where $N_i$ is some neighborhood of node $i$ in the graph.\n","\n","To easily compare coefficients across different nodes, we normalize the coefficients across $j$ using a softmax function:\n","\\begin{equation}\n","\\alpha_{ij} = \\text{softmax}_j(e_{ij}) = \\frac{\\exp(e_{ij})}{\\sum_{k \\in N_i} \\exp(e_{ik})}\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","For this problem, our attention mechanism $a$ will be a single-layer feedforward neural network parametrized by a weight vectors $\\overrightarrow{a_l} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F'}$ and $\\overrightarrow{a_r} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F'}$, followed by a LeakyReLU nonlinearity (with negative input slope 0.2).

These aggregated features will serve as the final output features for every node.\n","\n","\\begin{equation}\n","h_i' = \\sum_{j \\in N_i} \\alpha_{ij} \\mathbf{W_r} \\overrightarrow{h_j}.\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","At this point, we have covered a lot of information! Before reading further about multi-head attention, we encourage you to go again through the excersize of thinking about what components of the attention mechanism correspond with the different functions: 1) `forward`, 2) `message`, and 3 `aggregate`.\n","\n","- Hint 1: Our aggregation is very similar to that of GraphSage except now we are using sum aggregation\n","- Hint 2: The terms we aggregate over again represent the individual message that each neighbor node j sends. Thus, we see that $\\alpha_{ij}$ is part of the message each node sends and is thus computed during the message step. This makes sense since an attention weight is associated with each edge in the graph.\n","- Hint 3: Look at the terms in the definition of $\\alpha_{ij}$. What values do we want to pre-process and pass as parameters to the `propagate` function. The parameters of `message(..., x_j, alpha_j, alpha_i, ...)` should give a good hint.  \n","\n","### Multi-Head Attention\n","To stabilize the learning process of self-attention, we use multi-head attention.
